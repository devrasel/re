If you wish to use an alternative method for registering WoOCommerce form fields, you can use WooCommerce hooks to edit WooCommerce my account page.

The following code snippet illustrates the process:


function woocommerce_edit_my_account_page() {
    return apply_filters( 'woocommerce_forms_field', array(
        'woocommerce_my_account_page' => array(
            'type'        => 'text',
            'label'       => __( 'Socail Media Profile Link', ' speakbd' ),
            'placeholder' => __( 'Profile Link', 'speakbd' ),
            'required'    => false,
        ),
    ) );
}
function edit_my_account_page_woocommerce() {
    $fields = woocommerce_edit_my_account_page();
    foreach ( $fields as $key => $field_args ) {
        woocommerce_form_field( $key, $field_args );
    }
}
add_action( 'woocommerce_register_form', 'edit_my_account_page_woocommerce', 15 );


The above snippet starts with the woocommerce_edit_my_account_page() that is used in the later part of the snippet. This function returns a multidimensional array that contains the information about the fields (type, label, placeholder, required or not) that you are adding to the form.

To ensure that the values of the fields can be updated further on, the array is further processes through the woocommerce_form_field() function.

in the next half of the snippet, I have used the edit_my_account_page_woocommerce() function. As you can see the $fields variable contains the array generated by the woocommerce_edit_my_account_page() function. This is looped through using the foreach() loop.

Adding Your Required WooCommerce Form Field
As you can see this above mentioned snippet is very flexible and you can add any field type that you wish by providing the appropriate field structure value in the $fields array.

Here are a few examples:

Textarea

'woocommerce_my_account_page' => array(
         'type'        => 'textarea',
         'label'       => __( 'Socail Media Profile Link', 'speakbd' ),
         'placeholder' => __( 'Profile Link', 'speakbd' ),
         'required'    => false,
     ),
checkbox

'woocommerce_my_account_page_checkbox'   => array(
           'type'  => 'checkbox',
           'label' => __( 'Checkbox', 'speakbd' ),
       ),
Option list

'woocommerce_my_account_page_select'     => array(
           'type'    => 'select',
           'label'   => __( 'Select Field', 'speakbd' ),
           'options' => array(
               '' => __( 'Select an options.', 'speakbd' ),
               1  => __( 'WooCommerce forms', 'speakbd' ),
               2  => __( 'WooCommerce  my account page', 'speakbd' ),
               3  => __( 'WooCommerce edit my account page', 'speakbd' ),
               4  => __( 'How to edit WooCommerce my account page', 'speakbd' ),
               5  => __( 'Edit my account page WooCommerce', 'speakbd' ),
           ),
